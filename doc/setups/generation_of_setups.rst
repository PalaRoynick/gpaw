Setup generation
================

The generation of setups, starts from a spin-paired atomic
all-electron calculation with spherical symmetry.

1) Select the states to include as valence.

2) Add extra unbound states for extra flexibility.

3) Select cutoff radius (may be `\ell`-dependent).

4) From the set of bound and unbound all-electron partial waves
   (`\phi_{n\ell}(r)`) construct pseudo partial waves
   (`\tilde\phi_{n\ell}(r)`).

This is done by the :ref:`cli` tool ``gpaw dataset``::

    usage: gpaw dataset [-h] [-f <XC>] [-C CONFIGURATION]
                        [-P PROJECTORS] [-r RADIUS]
                        [-0 nderivs,radius] [-c radius]
                        [-z type,nderivs] [-p]
                        [-l spdfg,e1:e2:de,radius] [-w] [-s] [-n]

Type ``gpaw dataset --help`` to get started.


Example
=======

Generate dataset for nitrogen and check logarithmic derivatives::

    $ gpaw dataset N -fPBE -s -P 2s,s,2p,p,d,F -r 1.3 -l spdfg -p

.. image:: nitrogen-log-derivs.png

When things look OK, you can write it to a :ref:`PAW-XML <pawxml>` file::

    $ gpaw dataset N -fPBE -s -P 2s,s,2p,p,d,F -r 1.3 -t new -w

and use it in you calculations with ``setups={'N': 'new'}``.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`using_your_own_setups`
   * :ref:`Using the setups parameter <manual_setups>`
   * The ``gpaw atom`` command-line tool for doing an all-electron calculation
     for an atom

What an OK dataset looks like will depend on what you want:

* If you want a very accurate dataset then you will want to include semi-core
  states and reduce the cutoff radii.  Also, you should try to get
  correct scattering properties at high energies (check this by looking at
  the logarithmic derivatives).

* If you want something that is computationally efficient then you will want
  as few valence electrons as possible and as large cutoff radii as
  possible.

Always do test calculations to compare the performance of your dataset
against accurate all-electron reference calculations.

.. warning::

   The ``gpaw dataset`` generator (:git:`~gpaw/atom/generator2.py`)
   is work in progress and does not have a stable API.  If you manage to
   generate a dataset with is that you want to use then hold on to that
   file because we can not guarantee that future versions of GPAW will be
   able to generate it again.

   The :ref:`setup releases` that we distribute are all generated with the
   old ``gpaw-setup`` generator (see more :ref:`below <generator1>`).


.. _using_your_own_setups:

Using your own setups
=====================

The setups you generate must be placed in a directory which is included in
the environment variable :envvar:`GPAW_SETUP_PATH` in order for GPAW to
find them. If you want to use the setups in your local directory, add the
following lines to the beginning of your Python script::

    from gpaw import setup_paths
    setup_paths.insert(0, '.')

You can also override the environment variable :envvar:`GPAW_SETUP_PATH` so
that it lists the local directory first and the regular entries afterwards.

If you use bash, :envvar:`GPAW_SETUP_PATH` can be temporarily modified
while you run GPAW with the single command::

    GPAW_SETUP_PATH=.:$GPAW_SETUP_PATH python3 script.py

or if you are using csh or tcsh, you have to first run ``setenv`` and then
GPAW::

    setenv GPAW_SETUP_PATH .:$GPAW_SETUP_PATH&& python3 script.py


.. _generator1:

Old generator
=============

The following parameters define a setup:

=================  =======================  =================

=================  =======================  =================
``core``           Froze core               ``'[Ne]'``
``rcut``           Cutoff radius/radii for  ``1.9``
                   projector functions
``extra``          Extra non-bound          ``{0: [0.5]}``
                   projectors
``vbar``           Zero-potential           ``('poly', 1.7)``

                   compensation charges
=================  =======================  =================

The default (LDA) sodium setup can be generated with the command ``gpaw-setup
Na``, which will use default parameters from the file
``gpaw/atom/generator.py``. See :ref:`manual_xc` for other functionals.
