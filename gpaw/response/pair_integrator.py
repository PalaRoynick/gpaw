class PairFunctionIntegrator(ABC):
    r"""Baseclass for computing pair functions in the Kohn-Sham system.

    The implementation is currently restricted collinear periodic crystals in
    absence of spin-orbit coupling.

    In the Kohn-Sham system, pair functions (see the PairFunciton class for
    further descriptions) can be constructed straight-forwardly as a sum over
    transitions between Kohn-Sham eigenstates at k and k + q,
                  __  __  __                            __
               1  \   \   \                          1  \
    pf(q,z) =  ‾  /   /   /   pf_nks,n'k+qs'(q,z) =  ‾  /  pf_T(q,z)
               V  ‾‾  ‾‾  ‾‾                         V  ‾‾
                  k  n,n' s,s'                          T

    where V is the crystal volume and T is a composite index encoding all
    relevant transitions:

    T: (n, k, s) -> (n', k + q, s')

    The sum over transitions can be split into two steps: (1) an integral over
    k-points k inside the 1st Brillouin Zone and (2) a sum over band and spin
    transitions t:

    t (composite transition index): (n, s) -> (n', s')
                  __                 __  __                  __
               1  \               1  \   \                1  \
    pf(q,z) =  ‾  /  pf_T(q,z) =  ‾  /   /  pf_kt(q,z) =  ‾  /  (...)_k
               V  ‾‾              V  ‾‾  ‾‾               V  ‾‾
                  T                  k   t                   k

    In the code, the k-point integral is handled by a KPointPairIntegral
    object, while the sum over band and spin transitions t is carried out in
    the self.add_integrand() method, which also defines the specific pair
    function in question.

    KPointPairIntegral:
       __
    1  \
    ‾  /  (...)_k
    V  ‾‾
       k

    self.add_integrand():
                __                __   __
                \                 \    \
    (...)_k  =  /  pf_kt(q,z)  =  /    /   pf_nks,n'k+qs'(q,z)
                ‾‾                ‾‾   ‾‾
                t                 n,n' s,s'

    In practise, the integration is carried out by letting the
    KPointPairIntegral extract individual KohnShamKPointPair objects, which
    contain all relevant information about the Kohn-Sham eigenstates at k and
    k + q for a number of specified spin and band transitions t.
    KPointPairIntegral.weighted_kpoint_pairs() generates these kptpairs along
    with their integral weights such that self._integrate() can construct the
    pair functions in a flexible, yet general manner.

    NB: Although it is not a fundamental limitation to pair functions as
    described above, the current implementation is based on a plane-wave
    represenation of spatial coordinates. This means that symmetries are
    analyzed with a plane-wave basis in mind, leaving room for further
    generalization in the future.
